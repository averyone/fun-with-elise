<h1>Video</h1>

<p>In 2020, during COVID, it felt like there was nothing to do and nowhere to go. It seemed like the world had hit pause. Social media and TV became the main forms of entertainment for most people. I felt trapped inside and tuned out the news because it seemed like everything was going badly. During that time, I turned to YouTube and found some channels that helped take my mind off things.</p>

<p>The two main channels were Danny Gonzalez and Daz Games. Both are comedic creators who brought humor into a very bleak time. Danny runs a commentary channel that makes fun of things like influencers and movies. Daz is a horror gamer who gets easily frightened and also makes fun of internet videos. Together, their content gave me moments of laughter when I needed it most.</p>

<p>Another YouTuber from that time, and the one who became my favorite, is Kurtis Conner. Out of the three, he is definitely the funniest, especially because he is also a stand-up comedian. Iâ€™ve even seen him perform live twice, on two separate tours. His comedy feels both relatable and sharp, making him stand out from other creators. Watching his content has continued to bring me joy long after that difficult year.!</p>
