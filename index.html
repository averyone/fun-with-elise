<h1>Welcome to Elise's Home Page</h1>

<p>Hello! Welcome to my website! My name is <strong>Elise Kadison</strong>, and I am a student at Texas State University. My major is <em><a href="https://sjmc.txst.edu/programs/dmi.html" target="_blank">Digital Media Innovation</a></em> in the <em><a href="https://sjmc.txst.edu/" target="_blank">School of Journalism and Mass Communication</a></em>, and my minor is <a href="https://innovation.txst.edu/i-e-minor.html" target="_blank"><em>Innovation and Entrepreneurship</em></a>. I really enjoy my major because it allows me to work on creative projects such as social media, design, website creation, and journalistic articles. These projects fit perfectly with my visual and creative skills.</p>

<p>My minor supports my long-term dream of starting my own makeup company. For now, I plan to gain experience in the cosmetics industry through social media or marketing roles, which will help me build a strong foundation. I want to use my degree to enter the industry, learn more about how it works, and develop the skills I need to succeed. Ultimately, I hope to create a brand focused on innovative product functionality, mythical theming, inclusivity, and accessibility. This combination reflects both my creativity and my passion for building something meaningful.</p>

<p>At Texas State University, I enjoy shopping on The Square, swimming in the river, and dancing at The Marc. This semester, I joined several clubs including Her Campus, Boot Scootin' Bobcats, and FMA, which have given me opportunities to connect with others and build valuable experience for my resume. In addition, I have also been part of TXST Sirens, bringing my total involvement this semester to four clubs. Being active in these organizations has helped me grow both personally and professionally while making the most of my time on campus. I am now a senior and will be graduating this spring!</p>
